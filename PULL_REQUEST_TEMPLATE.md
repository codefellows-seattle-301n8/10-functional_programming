  1. <!-- TODO: Setup a template for each row of the Author Stats section of this page: -->
  Added handlebars template for author stats.
  2. <!-- TODO: Due to changes in article.js and articleView.js to attach their interior objects to a global 'app' object, we need to make changes to the contents of the following <script> tag: -->
  ?

article.js
  1. <!-- // TODO: Wrap the contents of this file, except for the preceding 'use strict' and 'var app...' declararions, in an IIFE.
  // Give the IIFE a parameter called 'module'.
  // At the very end of the code, but still inside the IIFE, attach the 'Article' object to 'module'.
  // Where the IIFE is invoked, pass in the global 'app' object that is defined above. -->

  2. <!-- // TODO: Refactor this forEach code, by using a `.map` call instead, since what we are trying to accomplish
  // is the transformation of one collection into another. Remember that we can set variables equal to the result
  // of functions. So if we set a variable equal to the result of a .map, it will be our transformed array.
  // There is no need to push to anything. -->

  3. <!-- // TODO: Chain together a `map` and a `reduce` call to get a rough count of all words in all articles. -->
